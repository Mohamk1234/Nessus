Using Nessus Essentials to scan local VMs hosted on VMWare Workstation in order run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities,
then perform a rescan to verify remediation.

The following file contains the steps i followed throughout this project

1. Downloading Vmware workstation player16, windows 10 iso, nessus essentials and installing everything.
2. Setting up the virtual machine running windows 10. Set the network connection to bridged and make sure to select the adapter that is connected to the local network.
3. Start the windows 10 VM and set it up. Ping the VM from your host system and make sure it replies. If not then disable all firewalls from the VM. 
4. After installing Nessus it will automatically open a browser window in which its GUI will run (it is a webapp). (https://localhost:8834/#/). Login using the credentials
   provided during installation. 
5. Perform a Basic Network Scan and provide the IP of the VM. (https://github.com/Mohamk1234/Nessus/blob/main/initialscan.pdf)
6. Go the the VM and enable remote registry so that the scanner can perform credentailed scan against it.
7. Turn on file and printer sharing and network discovery.
8. Change user account control settings, and modify it to never notify when apps try to make any changes.
9. Go to edit registry and create a new dword called LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy and change its value to 1.
10. Restart the VM.
11. Go the the Nessus portal and reconfigure the scan. Add windoes credentials for the VM, save and run the scan again. (https://github.com/Mohamk1234/Nessus/blob/main/secondscan.pdf)
12. Install a deprecated version of firefox on the VM (3.6.12)
13. Run the scan again. The amount of vulnerabilities will be high in this scan.
14. For vulnerability remediation, uninstall firefox, update windows to the latest version, also do the optional updates and scan again.
